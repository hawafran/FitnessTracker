This fitness tracker allows users to add specific workouts using the multiple peramiters including weight, time, and type.Users can create a new workout or continue the workout they had previously added. On the stats page users are presented with graphs which shows the total duration of the workout as well as the weights they lifted. 

Although the code was written for the total duration to be calculated the grraph does not update and the number comes back as undefined in the database. Additionally, although the app is working on the local host, the routes and models do not seem to be fully functioning in the heroku app.
